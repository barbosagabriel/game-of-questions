3. Add background music and sound effects
4. Add support for question categories, so the organizer can select the categories they want
5. Use https:opentdb.com/ as question source
6. Use LibreTranslate API to convert all questions to Portuguese (Brazil)
7. Deploy the app to a public server so people can play
8. Change the timer to show a progress bar instead of a countdown number
9. Add animations when showing the correct answer and updating scores
10.Let the players select a character/avatar when joining the game
11.Use the avatar on the final rankings screen
12. Change the score logic to give more points for faster answers - something like: right answer 10 points plus a bonus of time taken in seconds, faster answers get higher bonus ( display that to the users after each question )
