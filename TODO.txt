TODO:
1. Improve design for the app (use design prototype as reference)
2. Add background music and sound effects
6. Add animations when showing the correct answer and updating scores
7. Let the players select a character/avatar when joining the game
8. Use the avatar on the final rankings screen
9. Change the score logic to give more points for faster answers - something like: right answer 10 points plus a bonus of time taken in seconds, faster answers get higher bonus ( display that to the users after each question )
